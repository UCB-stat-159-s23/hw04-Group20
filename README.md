This repository is a Reproducible Research Package for the [LIGO Gravitational Wave Detection Tutorial](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). It builds upon the work from HW02, and we have added additional structure, tests, a [JupyterBook](https://ucb-stat-159-s23.github.io/hw04-Group20/LOSC_Event_tutorial.html), and other improvements to make it more reproducible.
